#AIM OF EXPERIMENT : writing linear search program  by using iterative function .
#LINERA SEARCH : This is used to find the key element in a given array by comaring key element with all elements all elements in array and elements in array are not in sorted order.
#PROCEDURE:
First we have to take an array of n elements i.e p[] = {12,61,33,92,36,3,29,98,54,60}. Assign ‘a’ to iterate the loop. Given Key elements = 36,100
By considering for loop i.e (a = 0;a<n;a++)(this for loop iterates each element in array).
By stating if condition  i.e if(p[a] == key element)
If the above condition is true we get output as position of key element  i.e ‘a’(“printf(“%d”,a),given the key element is 36 then it prints position i.e “4”.
By stating else condition we say that if element not found print(“element not found”).
So for the key element 100 it prints “element not found”)
#INPUT :
                 36  100
#OUTPUT:
                 4
                 Element not found

# AIM OF EXPERIMENT : writing linear search program by using recursive function.
# LINEAR SEARCH  :  This search is use to find key element in given array  if key element is present it prints key element.
# PROCEDURE  : 
First we have to take an array i.e. p[] = {12,61,33,92,36,3,29,,98,54,60}
By using for loop iterate the loop ,to iterate the loop consider a variable “a”. i.e. for(a=0;a<=n;a++)
Where n is element index of last element.
Then ,if the element is found its prints position of key element.
If the value  of” a”  reaches greater than n it returns -1 to main function.
In the main function declare variables and scan the value of element.
If value of index is -1 then it prints element is not found
Else  print the index of element as output.
INPUT:
            12
              100
OUTPUT:
                 4
                 Element not found
